This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return incorrect dimensions initially, particularly if the app is launched quickly or there's a race condition.  This leads to layout issues or incorrect calculations based on faulty width and height values.
